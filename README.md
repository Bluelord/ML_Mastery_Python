## Machine Learning Mastery with Python

This repository has the notebooks for prectice code and notes, taken from
Machine Learning Mastery with python by [Jason Brawnlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/about/).
This book focues on a specific sub-field of machine learning called predictive modeling, 
which is the most useful in industry and thge type of machine learning that the scikit-learn library in Python excels.

[**Lessons:**](https://github.com/Bluelord/ML_Mastery_Python/blob/30e06294799bcf9de7eec2a5794c3c540cca79c9/Lessons/README.md) Learn how the sub-tasks of a machine learning project map onto Python and the best practice way of working through each task.

[**Projects:**](https://github.com/Bluelord/ML_Mastery_Python/blob/39c1c0e6b63a37fe012eafbcd9eb9a940cead1ce/Projects/README.md) Tie together all of the knowledge from the lessons by working through case study
predictive modeling problems.

From this book we will know how to work on small to medium size dataset, 
how to build a modle that can make accurate predictions on new data, 
we wil learn new and different techniques in python and scipy.

## Machine Learning Mastery with Python

This repository has the notebooks for prectice code and notes, taken from
Machine Learning Mastery with python by [Jason Brawnlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/about/).
This book focues on a specific sub-field of machine learning called predictive modeling, 
which is the most useful in industry and thge type of machine learning that the scikit-learn library in Python excels.

Lessons : Learn how the sub-tasks of a machine learning project map onto Python and the
best practice way of working through each task.

### Python Ecosystem for ML

Python is a general purpose interpreted programming language. It is easy to learn and use
primarily because the language focuses on readability.

SciPy is an ecosystem of Python libraries for mathematics, science and engineering.
The SciPy ecosystem is comprised of the following core modules relevant to machine learning:
- NumPy: A foundation for SciPy that allows you to efficiently work with data in arrays.
- Matplotlib: Allows you to create 2D charts and plots from data.
- Pandas: Tools and data structures to organize and analyze your data.

The scikit-learn library is how you can develop and practice machine learning in Python.
The focus of the library is machine learning algorithms for classification, regression,
clustering and more. It also provides tools for related tasks such as evaluating models, tuning
parameters and pre-processing data.
